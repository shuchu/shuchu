### Feast Feature Server Improvements
After few discussion among the maintainers, we decided to have the following plan for Feast feature server:   
1, Work on the Python version of featuer server first. Focus on reducing the latency.   
2, Fix the Java version. drop transformation service for odfvs.   
3, remove the Apache Arrow library dependecies from the code.    

My current plan of reducing the latency of Python Feature Server.   
1, Modify the existing benchmark code to run it locally.    
2, Build a Helm chart for deploy a Feast Feature Server to k8s.   
3, Add the monitor metrics and traces.   
4, Evaluation.   
5, (TBD) optimization directions: using asnyc
6, Improve the peformance of using Redis as online feature store.
