### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### DB-GPT
1. Start reading.

### Feast.dev (last update: Dec-18-2023)
Tecton will move the Feast project to the Linux foundation(https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). I will stop on it until this transfer is done. (Coz no reviewers for it now.)  
#### Tasks Queue 
1. (done) ~~FeatureView name conflicts between streaming Featureview and regular FeatureView:~~ [#3836](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues/3836),[#3805](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues/3805)
2. (done) ~~SnowFlake Feature Store requires READ-only property, as there is an unnecessary "CREATE Table" logic over there. [#3844](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues/3844)~~
3. Pydantic 2.0 upgradation. [#3778](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues/3778)
4. "Go" Feature server improvement.

#### Backlog
1. Add the vector database (https://qdrant.tech/) as a data source.
2. Build a demo of RAG by LangChain, vLLM, and Feast.


<!--
#### Misc:
1. MIT 6.824 course project
2. C++ server-side programming practice.
